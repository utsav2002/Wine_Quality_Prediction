# Wine_Quality_Prediction
Overview: This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties. It includes a machine learning model trained on red and white wine datasets.

Files Description:
CSC2034_Project.py: Contains initial setup or configuration code. It appears to include commands related to setting up a Python environment, but the details are incomplete in the preview.
main.py: The main script for the project. It includes data handling and visualization using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, and machine learning models from sklearn and imblearn.
winequality-red.csv and winequality-white.csv: These are datasets containing physicochemical properties and quality ratings for red and white wines, respectively.
winequality.names: Documentation file providing citation information for the datasets used in this project.

Datasets:
The datasets (winequality-red.csv and winequality-white.csv) consist of several columns representing physicochemical properties like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, etc., along with a quality score.
